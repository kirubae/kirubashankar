        <p>
          This is a personal website with free tools. Use them responsibly.
          Don't do anything illegal or harmful. That's pretty much it.

        <h2>What This Site Does</h2>
        <p>
          {SITE.name.split(' ')[0]}'s website offers various free tools for
          productivity and data processing. Some tools require you to sign in
          with Google to access them.

      <section class="mb-8">
        <h2>Your Account</h2>
        <p>
          When you sign in with Google, we create an account for you. Keep your
          Google account secure — that's your responsibility. If you notice any
          weird activity, let me know.
        </p>

      <section class="mb-8">
        <h2>Using the Tools</h2>
        <ul>

        <h2>Your Data</h2>
        <p>
          Any files you upload are processed and then deleted. I don't keep copies
          of your data longer than necessary. Check the <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>

      <section class="mb-8">
        <h2>No Warranties</h2>
        <p>
          These tools are provided "as is". They work well, but I can't guarantee
          100% uptime or that they'll work perfectly for every edge case. If
          something breaks, I'll do my best to fix it.

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>

          I'm not liable for any damages that might result from using these tools.
          If you're processing important data, always keep backups.
        </p>

      <section class="mb-8">
        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>
          I might update these terms occasionally. If there are major changes,
          I'll update the date at the top. Continued use of the site means you
          accept any changes.
