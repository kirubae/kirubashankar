        <h2>The Short Version</h2>
        <p>
          I collect minimal data, only what's needed to make the tools work.
          I don't sell your data or share it with third parties. Your files
          are processed and deleted — I don't keep them.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-8">
        <h2>What I Collect</h2>

        <h3>When You Sign In</h3>
        <p>
          If you sign in with Google, I receive your name, email, and profile
          picture from Google. This creates your account and lets you access
          the tools.
        </p>

        <h3>When You Use Tools</h3>
        <p>
          I log which tools you use and when. This helps me understand which
          tools are popular and identify issues. I don't log the actual content
          of your files.
        </p>

        <h3>Files You Upload</h3>
        <p>
          Files you upload are processed temporarily and then automatically
          deleted. I don't store your files permanently or look at their contents.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-8">
        <h2>How I Use Your Data</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>To provide and improve the tools</li>
          <li>To authenticate you and manage your account</li>
          <li>To understand usage patterns and fix bugs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          That's it. No marketing, no selling data, no creepy stuff.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>This site uses:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Supabase</strong> — For authentication and database (stores your account info)</li>
          <li><strong>Google OAuth</strong> — For signing in with your Google account</li>
          <li><strong>Cloudflare</strong> — For hosting and file storage</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each of these has their own privacy policies. They're all reputable
          services with strong privacy practices.
        </p>

      <section class="mb-8">
        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          I use cookies only for authentication — to keep you logged in.
          No tracking cookies, no analytics cookies. Just the essentials.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-8">
        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Account data:</strong> Kept while your account is active</li>
          <li><strong>Usage logs:</strong> Kept for up to 90 days</li>
          <li><strong>Uploaded files:</strong> Deleted within 24 hours of processing</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-8">
        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Request a copy of your data</li>
          <li>Ask me to delete your account and data</li>
          <li>Stop using the service anytime</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Just reach out and I'll help you out.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-8">
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
          I take reasonable measures to protect your data. All connections are
          encrypted (HTTPS), and I use trusted services for authentication and
          storage. But no system is 100% secure — that's just how the internet works.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-8">
        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>
          If I make significant changes to this policy, I'll update the date
          at the top. Feel free to check back occasionally.
